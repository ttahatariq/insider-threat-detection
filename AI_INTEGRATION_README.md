# AI-Powered Insider Threat Detection System

This system integrates OpenAI's GPT models to automatically analyze user behavior patterns and detect potential insider threats on a weekly basis.

## üöÄ Features

### AI-Powered Analysis
- **Weekly Automated Analysis**: Runs every Sunday at 2:00 AM UTC
- **Real-time Risk Scoring**: Uses AI to analyze behavior patterns and assign risk scores
- **Intelligent Pattern Recognition**: Detects unusual access patterns, timing anomalies, and suspicious behavior
- **Fallback Analysis**: Rule-based analysis when AI is unavailable

### Automated Actions
- **User Blocking**: Automatically blocks users with high risk scores (‚â•80%)
- **Monitoring**: Flags users with medium risk scores (‚â•60%) for enhanced monitoring
- **Admin Alerts**: Sends detailed email notifications about suspicious activities
- **Weekly Reports**: Comprehensive summaries sent to administrators

### Scheduling & Monitoring
- **Automated Scheduling**: Uses node-cron for reliable task execution
- **Health Checks**: Daily system health monitoring at 6:00 AM UTC
- **Monthly Analysis**: Extended 30-day analysis on the first of each month
- **Manual Triggers**: Admin can manually trigger analysis when needed

## üõ†Ô∏è Setup Instructions

### 1. Install Dependencies
```bash
npm install openai node-cron
```

### 2. Environment Variables
Create a `.env` file with the following variables:

```env
# OpenAI API Configuration
OPENAI_API_KEY=your-openai-api-key-here

# Database Configuration
MONGO_URI=mongodb://localhost:27017/insider_threat_detection

# Email Configuration
EMAIL_USER=your-email@gmail.com
EMAIL_PASS=your-app-password

# JWT Secret
JWT_SECRET=your-jwt-secret-key-here

# Server Configuration
PORT=5500
NODE_ENV=development
```

### 3. OpenAI API Key
1. Sign up at [OpenAI](https://openai.com/)
2. Get your API key from the dashboard
3. Add it to your `.env` file

### 4. Start the System
```bash
npm run dev
```

The scheduler will automatically initialize when the server starts.

## üìä How It Works

### Weekly Analysis Process
1. **Data Collection**: Gathers all user activities from the past 7 days
2. **AI Analysis**: Sends behavior data to OpenAI for pattern analysis
3. **Risk Assessment**: AI returns risk scores and recommendations
4. **Action Execution**: Automatically blocks high-risk users or flags for monitoring
5. **Notification**: Sends detailed reports to administrators

### AI Analysis Components
- **Time Distribution**: Analyzes when users are most active
- **Action Patterns**: Identifies unusual sequences of actions
- **Access Patterns**: Detects rapid succession and unusual timing
- **Role-based Analysis**: Considers user roles in risk assessment
- **IP Address Tracking**: Monitors for suspicious access locations

### Risk Scoring
- **0.0 - 0.4**: Low Risk (Normal behavior)
- **0.4 - 0.7**: Medium Risk (Monitor closely)
- **0.7 - 1.0**: High Risk (Block immediately)

## üìÖ Scheduling Configuration

### Weekly Analysis
- **Schedule**: Every Sunday at 2:00 AM UTC
- **Purpose**: Comprehensive user behavior analysis
- **Actions**: Block high-risk users, flag medium-risk users

### Daily Health Check
- **Schedule**: Every day at 6:00 AM UTC
- **Purpose**: System health monitoring
- **Checks**: Database connection, API keys, email configuration

### Monthly Analysis
- **Schedule**: First day of month at 3:00 AM UTC
- **Purpose**: Extended 30-day trend analysis
- **Output**: Comprehensive monthly report

## üéØ AI Analysis Features

### Behavior Pattern Detection
- **Data Exfiltration**: Downloads, exports, file transfers
- **Unauthorized Access**: Unusual file access patterns
- **Suspicious Timing**: After-hours activity, weekend access
- **Privilege Escalation**: Admin access attempts
- **Data Modification**: Unusual file changes

### Risk Factors
- **High download activity** during work hours
- **Multiple IP addresses** used by same user
- **Rapid succession** of actions
- **After-hours activity** exceeding normal patterns
- **Role violations** (e.g., intern accessing admin files)

## üìß Email Notifications

### Admin Alerts
- **Immediate notifications** for high-risk activities
- **Detailed analysis** with AI insights
- **Action recommendations** for administrators
- **Risk score breakdowns** with explanations

### Weekly Reports
- **Summary statistics** for all users
- **AI insights** and trend analysis
- **User violation details** with risk scores
- **Action taken** summaries

## üîç Monitoring & Debugging

## üîí Security Considerations

### Data Privacy
- User activity data is analyzed locally before sending to OpenAI
- Only aggregated patterns are sent to AI service
- No sensitive file contents are transmitted

### Access Control
- All AI analysis routes require Admin authentication
- User data is protected by role-based access control
- Audit logs track all administrative actions

### Rate Limiting
- OpenAI API calls are rate-limited to prevent abuse
- Fallback analysis ensures system continues working
- Health checks monitor API usage

## üìà Performance Optimization

### Analysis Efficiency
- Batch processing for multiple users
- Caching of analysis results
- Asynchronous processing for non-blocking operations

### Database Optimization
- Indexed queries for activity logs
- Aggregated data storage for trends
- Efficient pagination for large datasets

### AI Integration
- Structured prompts for consistent analysis
- Fallback mechanisms for reliability
- Configurable thresholds for flexibility

## üîÆ Future Enhancements
